# 🧠 Local AI Agent

A simple, modular, and privacy-first autonomous AI agent that runs entirely **locally** on your machine — no internet or API calls needed! 

> 🔒 Your data. Your control. Your AI.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🖥️ **Local-first**: Run powerful LLMs, embeddings, and tools entirely offline.
- 🧩 **Modular architecture**: Easily plug in different models and tools.
- 🔧 **Extensible tools**: Add your own custom tools to increase agent capabilities.
- 🔁 **Autonomous agent loop**: Let the AI plan and execute tasks step-by-step.
- 🧠 **LLM + Embeddings support**: Choose your favorite local models for reasoning and retrieval.
- 🗃️ **Memory support**: Includes vectorstore for embedding-based memory and recall.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- `Python 3.11+`
- [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain)
- [llama-cpp-python](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python)
- [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)
- [ChromaDB](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma)
- `Streamlit` (for UI - planned)
- `typer` (CLI)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Git
- A supported LLM (e.g., LLaMA, Mistral) downloaded locally.

### 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tejas3103/local-AI-agent.git
cd local-AI-agent
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🧪 Running the Agent

```bash
python main.py
```

You can customize the models, tools, and memory in `config.py`.

├── agent/              # Core agent logic
├── tools/              # Built-in tools (e.g., web search, code exec)
├── memory/             # Memory and embeddings store
├── models/             # Model loader and config

├── main.py             # Entry point
└── requirements.txt    # Dependencies
```

## 🔌 Extending the Agent

You can easily add:

- 🛠️ New tools → Drop into `tools/`
- 🧠 New models → Configure in `models/`
- 🗂️ New memory backends → Add to `memory/`

---

## 🗣️ Why Use This?

- No need to rely on OpenAI or cloud APIs.
- Great for privacy-sensitive tasks.
- Useful for local personal assistants, automation agents, or just experimenting with autonomous agents.
